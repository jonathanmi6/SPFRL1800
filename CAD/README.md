### Notes on materials:

#### Acrylic:
* The main keyboard laters (6 total) are 430mm x 125mm and the 3 feet layers together is 430mm x 195mm
* 24"x18" size sheets are optimal as you can perfectly fit all the layers on 3 sheets
  * If you split the layer colors as done in the samples, 2 layers of primary color and 1 layer of secondary color is enough for the entire keyboard.
  * Minus the foggy/transparent layer on the wrist rest, this is enough to make both keyboard and wrist rest

#### Plate Materials
* Any plate material 1.5mm or 1/16" thick will be OK, though I advise against 1.5mm thick acrylic as it is rather fragile and can easily break
* 3mm plate should be perfectly fine, but it is currently untested

#### Hardware
* I've used LP SHCS bolts for aschetics, but any pan head or button head bolt should work as well
* If you have access to a grinder, the cheapo way is to purchase only the 10mm and 16mm bolts. There were some issues with the top 10mm bolts being a tad short due to variation in the bolt length and standoff effective threadlength. Since there will be extra 16mm bolts, you can grind them down to 11mm long to resolve the issue when it occurs (2-3 bolts typically). 
* However, I highly recommend spending a few extra dollars and buy M3x12mm bolts for the top case and < 10mm long bolts for the front bottom bolts 


## Manufacturing

I recommend cutting a test piece (hexTestCut.STEP) to calibrate the hex standoff cutout for best fit. Modify the hex cutouts as needed based on laser cutter results.
